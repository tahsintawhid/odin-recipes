    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Soften butter.</strong>
            <br>The butter needs to be soft so that it can cream with the sugars well.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Whisk together dry ingredients.</strong>
            <br>Carefully measure flour, baking soda, and salt using measuring cups.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cream butter and sugars.</strong>
            <br>It should take about 3 minutes for butter and sugars to be light, fluffy, and very pale in color.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add eggs and vanilla extract.</strong>
            <br>Mix eggs and vanilla extract with the butter and sugar mixture with the mixer being on low.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add dry ingredients.</strong>
            <br>Add dry ingredients and mix on low until they're fully combined and don't overmix.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Refrigerate 20 minutes.</strong>
            <br>Chill the dough for 20 minutes while the oven heats up so that the center is soft as the cookie is
            baked.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake at 350Â°F for 9 to 12 minutes.</strong>
            <br>Use a heaping tablespoon to measure out the cookie dough onto the baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Deflate cookies.</strong>
            <br>Firmly tap the baking sheet on the counter to deflate the cookies and keep the centers soft.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Let it cool on the pan.</strong>
            <br>Let the cookies cool for about 5 to 10 minutes before you put them elsewhere.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Enjoy your cookies!</strong>
            <br>You can also pair your cookies with a glass of warm milk and treat yourself the way Santa Claus would.
