            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Soften butter.</strong>
                    The butter needs to be soft so that it can cream with the sugars well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Whisk together dry ingredients.</strong>
                    Carefully measure flour, baking soda, and salt using measuring cups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cream butter and sugars.</strong>
                    It should take about 3 minutes for butter and sugars to be light, fluffy, and very pale in color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add eggs and vanilla extract.</strong>
                    Mix eggs and vanilla extract with the butter and sugar mixture with the mixer being on low.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add dry ingredients.</strong>
                    Add dry ingredients and mix on low until they're fully combined and don't overmix.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Refrigerate 20 minutes.</strong>
                    Chill the dough for 20 minutes while the oven heats up so that the center is soft as the cookie is baked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bake at 350Â°F for 9 to 12 minutes.</strong>
                    Use a heaping tablespoon to measure out the cookie dough onto the baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deflate cookies.</strong>
                    Firmly tap the baking sheet on the counter to deflate the cookies and keep the centers soft.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Let it cool on the pan.</strong>
                    Let the cookies cool for about 5 to 10 minutes before you put them elsewhere.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enjoy your cookies!</strong>
                    You can also pair your cookies with a glass of warm milk and treat yourself the way Santa Claus would.
