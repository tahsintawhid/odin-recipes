    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a recipe for making <strong>Glazed Donuts</strong>
        which are a sweet snack made of fried dough. The fried dough can be topped or dipped
        with toppings or dips. Donuts were originally made in Germany and the Netherlands dating back to 1485,
        but didn't have their ring-shaped form we know today. The ring-shaped donuts were invented by Hanson Gregory,
        an American who made this donut because he didn't like the raw center of previous donuts. Donuts can be eaten by
        hand,
        and is often paired with coffee or milk.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Dry Yeast</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Whole Milk</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Nutmeg</li>
    <li>Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the dough.</strong>
            <br>The dough should be prepared with a mixer, but can also be done by hand.
            After the dough comes together, it should be kneaded for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Let the dough rise.</strong>
            <br>The dough should rise in about 90 minutes in a relatively warm environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Punch down the dough to release the air.</strong>
            <br>Releasing the air gives the donut a lighter and airy texture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Roll & cut into donuts.</strong>
            <br>The dough should be rolled out to a 1/2 inch thickness. The donuts should be cut using a
            3-3.5 inch donut cutter. The donuts should be placed on a baking sheet with parchment paper,
            where the donuts can rest while preparing the oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the oil.</strong>
            <br>The oil should be heaten up to 375°F and a cooling rack should be placed over another baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fry the doughnuts.</strong>
            <br>The donuts should be fried in the oil, being fried for 1 minute on each side. After that, the donut
            should
            be removed from the oil and placed on the cooling rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the glaze.</strong>
            <br>Sugar, whole milk, and the pure vanilla extract should be whisked together until they all mix
            thoroughly.
            While the donuts are still hot, they should be dipped into this glaze and both sides of the donut should be
            coated. Then, place the donut on the cooling rack
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Let it cool.</strong>
            <br>Let the donuts cool for 20 minutes on the cooling rack so that the glaze sets into the donut.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Enjoy your donuts!</strong>
            <br>You can also pair your donuts with a glass of warm milk, a cup of coffee, or on its own.
